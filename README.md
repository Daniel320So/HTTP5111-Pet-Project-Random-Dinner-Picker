# HTTP5111-Pet-Project-Random-Dinner-Picker

## Description
The purpose of this web application is to help users to randomly pick their meals so they no longer need to struggle about "What should I prepare for dinner?" anymore. It will first store a list of meal with different properties, such as name, ingredients, recipes, images, etc. The user then can click on the button to pick a meal randomly. There will also be a filtering function based on the meal properties, such as the main ingredients, so only the meal with selected ingredients will be picked. 

## MVP Features:
1, User can call the pick function to randomly get a meal from the meal list.
2, User can see the meal properties from the GUI
3, User can apply filter based on ingredients before picking a meal
4, User can add their own meal choice to the system (without a database to store the data for now) 

## Enhancement Features: 
1, User can see an animation on the GUI while the system is picking the meal
2, User can adjust the servings
